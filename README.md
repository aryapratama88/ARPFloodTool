## Introduction

ARP flooding is a technique used in network attacks to overwhelm a network's ARP table. This can lead to various issues, including service disruption and data interception. **ARPFloodTool** allows security professionals to simulate these attacks in a controlled environment. It helps test network defenses against ARP spoofing, ensuring better protection for your Wi-Fi networks.

## Features

- **Easy to Use**: Simple command-line interface.
- **ARP Flooding**: Simulate ARP flood attacks to test network resilience.
- **ARP Spoofing Tests**: Check the effectiveness of Wi-Fi security measures.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage for efficient operation.
- **Open Source**: Free to use and modify.

## Installation

To install **ARPFloodTool**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aryapratama88/ARPFloodTool.git
   cd ARPFloodTool
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Use pip to install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Tool**:
   After installation, you can run the tool using the command:
   ```bash
   python arpflood.py
   ```

For downloadable releases, check [ARPFloodTool Releases](https://github.com/aryapratama88/ARPFloodTool/releases). Download the latest version, extract it, and execute the file as described above.

## Usage

Using **ARPFloodTool** is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a quick guide to get you started:

1. **Basic Command**:
   To initiate an ARP flood attack, use:
   ```bash
   python arpflood.py --target <target_ip> --interface <network_interface>
   ```

2. **Options**:
   - `--target`: Specify the target IP address.
   - `--interface`: Specify the network interface (e.g., eth0, wlan0).

3. **Example**:
   ```bash
   python arpflood.py --target 192.168.1.5 --interface wlan0
   ```

4. **Help Command**:
   For more options, run:
   ```bash
   python arpflood.py --help
   ```

## How It Works

**ARPFloodTool** works by sending a large number of ARP requests to the target IP. This action fills the ARP cache of the target, leading to a denial of service. The tool uses raw sockets to send ARP packets, allowing it to operate at a low level of the network stack.

### Technical Overview

1. **ARP Protocol**: The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses.
2. **Flooding Technique**: By overwhelming the ARP cache, the tool can disrupt normal network operations.
3. **Packet Crafting**: The tool crafts ARP packets using the `scapy` library, allowing for customization and flexibility.

## Security Considerations

While **ARPFloodTool** is designed for testing and educational purposes, misuse can lead to legal issues. Always obtain permission before testing networks that you do not own. 

### Ethical Use

- Use the tool in controlled environments.
- Ensure compliance with local laws and regulations.
- Consider informing network administrators prior to testing.
